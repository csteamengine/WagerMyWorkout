# WagerMyWorkout
There are tons of workout websites and apps out there, but if there were a website that were based on social workouts, that would be awesome. You log in through facebook, and it automatically connects you with your friends. You can use the app, which tracks your workout, and then upload it to the website where you and your friends can see it. Your friends can give you cheers etc. You pick a workout plan, and stick to it. That way if you skip or miss a workout, your friends will know and be disappointed in you. 

# Goals
1. You can pledge money to your friends on this app, and if you don't workout then you have to pay them money. You can also wager drinks, shots, lunch, etc... When you start off, you can have a super high failure cost, and the longer you workout the lower it gets? You can select an excuse, and each excuse has a different value (family emergency - 100%, didn't want to workout - 0%). When you choose an excuse, it takes a certain amount off the money you promised your friend. You pay your friend whatever is left. 

2. It should also have a feed that displays what each person did for their workout. If others can see what you are doing for your workout it will push you to do your best. You can turn this off in the settings.

3. Preselected workout plans, including cardio, strength, agility, flexibility, and endurance. From beginner level to expert level.

Will need to find and test out all the other workout apps to see what I like/hate about each one, as well as what each one is missing. Then integrate each of those things into this app to make the perfect app.
