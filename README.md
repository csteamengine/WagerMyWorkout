# workout
There are tons of workout websites and apps out there, but if there were a website that were based on social workouts, that would be awesome. You log in through facebook, and it automatically connects you with your friends. You can use the app, which tracks your workout, and then upload it to the website where you and your friends can see it. Your friends can give you cheers etc. You pick a workout plan, and stick to it. That way if you skip or miss a workout, your friends will know and be disappointed in you. 

# todo
Will need to find and test out all the other workout apps to see what I like/hate about each one, as well as what each one is missing. Then integrate each of those things into this app to make the perfect app.
